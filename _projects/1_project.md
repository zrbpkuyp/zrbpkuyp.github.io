This is one of final project of Computing Generality A. 
Actually, it's not the one when I took the lesson. 
But I have a great interest in it, so I have a simple try using the method MCTS.
Below is something about it.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/nogo_1.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
